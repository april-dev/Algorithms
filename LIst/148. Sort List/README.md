First solution uses merge sort (recursion). But it consumes program stack to store the recurring function stack frame, actually it consumes o(lgn) space complexity.Recursion use up-to-bottom strategy.
Second solution uses bottom to up without recusion. Time complexity is the same O(NlogN). But space complexity is O(1).
