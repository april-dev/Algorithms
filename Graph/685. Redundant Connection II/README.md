This problem is very similar to "Redundant Connection". But the description on the parent/child relationships is much better clarified.

There are two cases for the tree structure to be invalid.
1) A node having two parents;
   including corner case: e.g. [[4,2],[1,5],[5,2],[5,3],[2,4]]
2) A circle exists
If we can remove exactly 1 edge to achieve the tree structure, a single node can have at most two parents. So my solution works in two steps.

1) Check whether there is a node having two parents. 
    If so, store them as candidates A and B, and set the second edge invalid. 
2) Perform normal union find. 
    If the tree is now valid 
           simply return candidate B
    else if candidates not existing 
           we find a circle, return current edge; 
    else 
           remove candidate A instead of B.
